			<h1>Hello there</h1>
			<p class="kenobi">General Kenobi.</p>
		
		<p> And welcome! 
			My name is Emilia (Em, Emi is fine, if you can't pronounce my name :'')), born in beautiful year of 1998. I am currently located in Finland, moved back just after pandemic at 2021. 
			 <br>I do some commission work for logodesign, but my main work is related to IT. <br><br>
			My interest are mostly gaming related, but I like to write and draw. Sometimes you might see me with my camera (which is Nikon D3100) but nowdays I don't have energy or time to do that.  

			 <br>
			<P>Currently studying in Laurea to become a cybersecurity specialist. So far it has been a joyride, so I can't complain. Lovely to meet new people and make them my friends. 
				And to re-learn some of the coding and stuff - which hasn't been a easy road to be fair. Excited of the future, and what it will entail for me.
			</p>
			<p>Hopefully you'll enjoy your time here; I am glad to have you :)  </p>
				<br>All photographs taken here are mine, unless stated otherwise. I use Affinity Photo for image processing and Affinity Design for graphics.
