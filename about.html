            <p> And welcome! 
                My name is Emilia (Em, Emi is fine, if you can't pronounce my name :'')), born in beautiful year of 1998. I am currently located in Finland, moved back just after pandemic at 2021. 
                 <br>I do some commission work for logodesign, but my main work is related to IT. <br><br>
                My interest are mostly gaming related, but I like to write and draw. Sometimes you might see me with my camera (which is Nikon D3100) but nowdays I don't have energy or time to do that.  
    
                 <br>
                <P>Currently studying in Laurea to become a cybersecurity specialist. So far it has been a joyride, so I can't complain. Lovely to meet new people and make them my friends. 
                    And to re-learn some of the coding and stuff - which hasn't been a easy road to be fair. Excited of the future, and what it will entail for me.
                </p>
                <p>Hopefully you'll enjoy your time here; I am glad to have you :)  </p>
                    <br>All photographs taken here are mine, unless stated otherwise. I use Affinity Photo for image processing and Affinity Design for graphics.
